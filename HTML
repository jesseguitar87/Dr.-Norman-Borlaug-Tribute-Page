        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1941 - </span>Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1942 - </span>Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1944 - </span>Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1945 - </span>Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> yields</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1953 - </span>crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1962 - </span>Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1970 - </span>receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">1983 - </span>helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br> sorghum yields</li>

        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">2005 - </span>states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
        <li class="info-list-item"><span id="date">2009 - </span>dies at the age of 95.</li>
